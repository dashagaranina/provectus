Implement asynchronous calculation of PI number up to a given number of correct digits.

For calculation of PI please use Gregory-Leibniz formula:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_%CF%80

Please create two different solutions described below.

## Task 1. Single-process solution
Create `StandaloneSolution` application (implements `main.java.foo.bar.baz.Solution`) that calculates PI number in a single JVM.
The calculations should be performed concurrently using Producer-Consumer pattern.
A Producer is a thread that generates jobs (messages) which are then executed by Consumer threads (workers).
When all the jobs are finished, the main task's result should be gathered and outputted.
